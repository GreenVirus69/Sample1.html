<p>Gonna be the last time<br>I'll do something fine<br>Cause im tired<b>to join the ride<br></p>
<p>You complain<br>I restrain<br>I work to help you<br>Can't you see I need help too?<br></p>
<p>My efforts are useless<br>I recieved words like daggers<br>They pierced through, the letters<br>
and open my eyes<br></p><p>If there's one thing<br>You need to know<br>Azrael never forgets<br>Azrael never forgives</p>
